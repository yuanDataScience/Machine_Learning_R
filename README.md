# Machine_Learning_R
This repo includes the markdown R scripts and R markdown notebook for the machine learning algorithms taught in the Coursera Machine Learning class by Professor Adrew Ng. In the class, all the assignments were implemented in MATLAB. In addition, some difficult parts of the assignments were already implemented before assigning to the learners.           
This project implemented the entire algorithms in R from scratch for all the assignments. The markdown files also included the derivation of the basic equations that were used in the implementation. According to my experience, this practice was not only helpful to practice the R programming language, but also helpful to strengthen the undersanding of the algorithms.            
It is important to note that the R code in this repo is far from being optimized for real machine learning applications. However, it provides a good starting point to understand the commonly used machine learning algorithms and practice R programming. If you have any suggestions that can make the algorithm better, please feel free to let me know.           

Finally, to see the HTML R markdown notebook, please use one of the following two methods:         
1. prepend the original github URL by http://htmlpreview.github.com/. For example, to see the LinearRegress.nb.html in LinearRegression folder of this repo, use the following link:           
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yuanDataScience/Machine_Learning_R/blob/master/LinearRegression/LinearRegress.nb.html          
2. use https://yuandatascience.github.io/Machine_Learning_R/folder name/html file name. For example, to see the LinearRegress.nb.html file in the folder Ex1, use the following link:          
https://yuandatascience.github.io/Machine_Learning_R/LinearRegression/LinearRegress.nb.html
