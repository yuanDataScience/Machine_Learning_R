# Machine_Learning_R
machine learning algorithm in R
The repo will include the major machine learning algorithm assignments in Coursera Machine Learning class by Professor Adrew Ng. In the class, all the assignments were implemented in MATLAB. In addition, some critical part of the assignment algorithms had been implemented as by the class in MATLAB. According to my personal experience of learning Machine Learning class, I feel it is very helpful to implement the entire assignment algorithms in R, including most of the code that had been implmented by the class. It is not only helpful to practice the R programming language, but also strengthen the undersanding of the algorithm. I will also list all the reference materials that I used to understand the algorithms. 
It is important to note that the R code in this repo is far from being optimized for real machine learning applications. It provides a good starting point to understand the commonly used machine learning algorithms and practice R programming. If you have any suggestions that can make the algorithm better, please feel free to let me know.
