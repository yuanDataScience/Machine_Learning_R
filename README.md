# Machine_Learning_R
This repo includes the markdown R scripts and R markdown notebooks for some commonly used machine learning algorithms. The markdown files also include the basic equations used in the algorithm implementation. Data exploration and visualization are implemented using ggplot2, and applications of the algorithms are demonstrated. I plan to inlcude at least 10 commonly used algorithms.                      
It is important to note that the R code in this repo is for the understanding of the algorithms, and provides a good starting point to understand the commonly used machine learning algorithms and practice R programming. If you have any suggestions that can make the algorithms better, please feel free to email me at yuanhuang100@gmail.com             
The Markdown notebooks in html format can be accessed from the HTML file below:
