# Machine_Learning_R
This repo will include the markdown R scripts and R markdown notebook for major machine learning algorithm assignments taught in the Coursera Machine Learning class by Professor Adrew Ng. In the class, all the assignments were implemented in MATLAB. In addition, some critical parts of the assignments had been implemented  by the class in MATLAB. 
According to my personal experience of learning Machine Learning algorithms, I feel it is very helpful to implement the entire assignment algorithms in R, including most of the code that had been implmented and provided by the class. It is not only helpful to practice the R programming language, but also to strengthen the undersanding of the algorithms. For each algorithm, I also included some of the derivations of the algorithm in the corresponding R markdown files. 
It is important to note that the R code in this repo is far from being optimized for real machine learning applications. It provides a good starting point to understand the commonly used machine learning algorithms and practice R programming. If you have any suggestions that can make the algorithm better, please feel free to let me know.          
Finally, to see the HTML R markdown notebook, please use one of the following two methods:
1. prepend the original github URL by http://htmlpreview.github.com/. For example, to see the LinearRegression.nb.html, use the following link: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yuanDataScience/Machine_Learning_R/blob/master/Ex1/LinearRegress.nb.html          
2. use https://yuandatascience.github.io/Machine_Learning_R/folder name/html file name. For example, to see the LinearRegression.nb.html file in the folder Ex1, use https://yuandatascience.github.io/Machine_Learning_R/Ex1/LinearRegress.nb.html
