# Machine_Learning_R
This repo includes the markdown R scripts and R markdown notebooks for the machine learning algorithms taught in the Coursera Machine Learning class by Professor Adrew Ng in R, including the parts that were implemented before assigning to the learners.                     
The markdown files also included the derivation of the basic equations that were used in the implementation. In addition to the algorithms taught in the Coursera course, I plan to add the implementation of some other commonly used algorithms such as softmax and EM algorithms.                      
It is important to note that the R code in this repo is far from being optimized for real machine learning applications. However, it provides a good starting point to understand the commonly used machine learning algorithms and practice R programming. If you have any suggestions that can make the algorithms better, please feel free to email me at yuanhuang100@gmail.com
The Markdown notebooks in html format can be accessed from the table below:
